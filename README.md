# literary_vs_nonliterary_classifier

Corpus-based experiment that investigates whether literary and non-literary texts in Catalan can be easily distinguished. To achieve this, I conducted basic statistical analyses and developed a Naïve Bayes classifier to identify informative features.

The data used for training, testing, and evaluating the classifier was sourced from CTILC (Corpus Textual Informatitzat de la Llengua Catalana)—an informatized textual corpus of the Catalan language. For more details, visit https://ctilc.iec.cat/scripts/CTILCCorpus_Descarr.asp
